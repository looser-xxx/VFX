I am working nicely on my PC and suddenly hear some strange noise.
I suddenly look behind.
I see a paper on the wall which had a warning called as do not touch.
The warning paper had a black(color) hole kind of thing in it.
I out of curiosity touched it and suddenly my hand became Black and White.
I then shake my hand out of fear.
I then come back to my computer trying to google this issue. 
I suddenly see that my whole RGB keyboard has become Black and White.
I then notice some black dot on my Monitor.
When I touched it my colorful Monitor(screen) turned black and white.
I then stood up and headed outside my room.
As I touched my wooden door it too turned black and white.
And then I saw a rose flower on the floor as I touched it, it too turned Black and White.
I then out of fear dropped the rose and found a Rs.200 note on the ground. 
I out of greed went to pick up that Note.
In this process, I touched the ground.
I felt an electric shock kind of thing and suddenly I realized that the whole world has become black and white.
